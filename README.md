# NintenTools

This is a .NET library to handle the BFRES Nintendo model file format, wrapping it in object oriented classes for your programs to handle them, closely trying to resemble what the original Nintendo tools might have provided to create the files.

The library is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syroot.NintenTools.Bfres).
